## Combat Roboports
Adds a new variant of roboport to the game that can deploy combat robots automatically.
Combat roboports are a lategame tech requiring utility science packs and are expensive, but in return they have long effective range and high damage. They use both combat robots as ammo and electricity.

The mod is compatible with Bob's Mods. When using Bob's Logistics I recommend to keep roboports enabled, it will work with roboports disabled but the recipe for the combat roboport becomes a mess.

**Known problems:**
- No animations on the combat roboport. This will be resolved as soon as the functionality is added to the modding API (implementation currently pending).
